    "# Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a method used to find the quantum states of a quantum system using variational methods. Such as those used in analytical mechanics when you are minimizing the variation of an action. In this case we are going to use this method to find the ground state energy of a molecule following the [tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html) offered by Xanad√∫ using PennyLane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are going to find the ground state wave function of the $H_2$ hydrogen molecule. This is going to be done starting from the ansatz $|\\Psi\\rangle = \\alpha|1100\\rangle + \\beta|0011\\rangle$. The obtention of this function is not clear for me at this moment. What I know is that this state will conserve certain type of antisymmetry since the two electrons involved must be represented by an antisymetrical function. This quantum state contemplates the spin state of the electrons and the orbitals that they are occupying, I think that is the reason why there are 4 quantum numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an ansatz PennyLane is going to optimize the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in order to minimize the energy of the ground stated.\n"

    "Now we have to specify the properties of the molecular state that we want to calculate. For this we have to provide three thing:\n",
    "- The geometry\n",
    "    This implies that we have to specify the coordinates in space of the atoms that compose the molecule of interest. This can be done using an special type of file for chemistry with extension `.xyz`. This file contains a table of the coordinates of the molecule's atoms. There are several databases of this files. Personally I liked [SMART-SNS](http://smart.sns.it/molecules/) because it shows you the position of the atoms in space and you can easily rotate the structure in order to visualize the molecule.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The charge\n",
    "    This charge represents the (integer) number of electrons that where added or removed from the neutral molecule. This could vary but, in most of the cases, the charge number will be 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The multiplicity\n",
    "    Corresponds to the multiplicity of a degenerated energy level due to the spin states of the unpaired electrons in the molecule. It is defined in terms of the total spin angular momentum $S$ as $M = 2S + 1$. This represents all the possible spin states of the molecule, then, these states are degenerated states because they have the same energy. In this case all electrons are paired so the spin of these electrons is $0$, then, multiplicity is $1$.\n"

In this case we are using the minimal basis STO-3g where a set of 3 gaussians (3g) represent an atomic Slater-type orbital (STO). That is why is called STO-3g."
