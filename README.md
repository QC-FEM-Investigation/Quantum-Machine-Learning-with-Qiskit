# Quantum Machine Learning with Qiskit

Welcome! This repo contains the files from QC-FEM's 2021-1 investigation project. At this point, it is but a blueprint. However, it is supposed to be on the solution of a binary classification problem using QML techniques.

## Structure of the repo

At this stage, there is only a ```logs``` directory, where members of the team are supposed to register their logs. It is expected that those correspond to markdown files. There is also a directory ```logs\Notebooks```, where exploration notebooks are to be located.
